# ft_printf
```ft_printf(const char *format, ...)```  
_ft_printf_ is a project, aimed to implement _printf_ function, which is a part of a standard C library, only using functions _write, malloc_ and _free_.

As an addition, _vasprintf_ and _asprintf_ functions were built (prototypes are _ft_vasprintf_ and _ft_asprintf_ respectively).

In order to increase the speed, I have decided to build the resulting string at first, and then output the whole string with just one _write_ function call completely.
To achieve this, I am saving processed string in a linked list, as I find it to be one of the best solutions in C, to deal with dynamic allocation.

For instance:  
```ft_printf("Hello %-7s, this is an example", "World");```  
function call will save the part before the percent sign into the first node of the linked list, resulting in a "Hello " string, 
then %7s will be processed as "World  " and saved in the second node, and the rest will be saved in the third node.
The result will look as this:  
  
_|Hello | -> |&nbsp;&nbsp;World| -> |, this is an example|_
  
  
After that, a string, which length is the same as sum of lengths of all strings of the list is allocated, content of the list is copied into the string
and outputed to the standard output with a  
```write(1, string, length_of_the_string)```

```ft_asprintf(char **str, const char *format, ...)```
Has the same functionality as _ft_printf_, however, instead of printing the resulting string to the standard output, sufficient memory is allocated for the _**str_ and string is copied there.
